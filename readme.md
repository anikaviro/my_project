## Mid Bootcamp Project - Exploratory Data Analytics


In this project I wanted to check some facts about the plastic waste management in the world and with a focus in the EU over the last 20 years.


## 1. Motivation:

Plastic production requires large amounts of fossil fuels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.
Many types of plastic cannot be recycled, leading to them being disposed of in landfills or incinerated.
Plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose and can harm wildlife and ecosystems in the meantime, especially marine life.
And for that reason, we see campaigns everywhere, products and all sorts of initiatives but, did we really reduce plastic consumption or increment recycling or is it more about feeling better about ourselves?


## 2. Features:

In the folder /slides you can find it in PDF, PPTX and a link to the Google Slides presentation (preferred format)

## 3. Data:

The data was collected from the [OECD website](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?QueryId=111245#) .
